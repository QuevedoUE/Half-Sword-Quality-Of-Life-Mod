Half Sword is an immersive, physics-based medieval combat simulator that offers players a unique experience of becoming a commoner-turned-knight, fighting brutal tournaments in 15th-century Europe. With innovative gameplay mechanics you can wield your weapon with
precision using your mouse, feeling the intensity of each clash as you ascend the ranks to face formidable opponents.

This mod enchances the normal HS gameplay in many ways

Features:
* Slow Motion Toggle (z)
* Better Fighting (At least for me)
* Infinte Stamina
* Set your own speed (F3 and writing in the console)
* Saves Loadout between matchs

To Do:
* Select the Slow Motion Intensity (EASY)

If you inject it in the menu and doesn't crash, the camera will have a better position to select the class.
For the mod to work better, inject it when you already played 2 matches for more posibilities to inject.
